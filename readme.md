# Animated Template
Sixth project for JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio

The project utilizes a [tailwind starter kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation) and a landing page template to customize the page with various animations. The main resource used in the project is an [animate on scroll library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). A [random user generator]() along with Unsplash photos were also utilized.

The main purpose of the project was to learn how to utilize/customize existing templates and libraries. As well as to learn how animations can be placed on page elements.
